## 🔑 Key Technologies Explained

### Next.js App Router
- **Server Components**: Faster page loads, better SEO
- **API Routes**: Backend endpoints in `/src/app/api/`
- **File-based Routing**: Each folder in `/src/app/` becomes a route

### TypeScript
- Type safety catches bugs before runtime
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework
- Responsive design built-in
- Consistent styling across components

---

## 🔐 Database & Authentication

### MongoDB
- Hosted on Digital Ocean (IP-restricted for security)
- Collections likely include: users, events, applications, etc.
- Connected via Mongoose or native MongoDB driver
- Two instances: Production (port 27017) and Development (port 27018)

### NextAuth.js
- Google OAuth integration for UMich emails
- Session management
- Protected routes via middleware
- Admin role system (12 admin emails configured)

### Security Features
- IP-restricted database access
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Server-side authentication checks
- Separate dev/prod credentials

---

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Production Setup (Digital Ocean)
```
Internet → Nginx (Port 80/443) → Next.js App (Port 3001) → MongoDB (Port 27017)
           (SSL/TLS)              (SystemD Service)          (Production DB)
```

### Components
- **Nginx**: Handles SSL/TLS, serves static files, reverse proxy
- **SystemD**: Manages Next.js process as a service (`abg-website.service`)
- **Next.js**: Built for production (`npm run build`)
- **MongoDB**: Database server (two instances: prod + dev)

### Key Files
- `nginx.conf` - Nginx configuration
- `abg-website.service` - SystemD service file
- `/etc/systemd/system/abg-website.service` - Service location on server

### How SystemD Works
- Automatically starts Next.js on server boot
- Auto-restarts if the application crashes
- Manages logs via `journalctl`
- Runs as a background service

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (`.env.local`)
4. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Access at `http://localhost:3001`

### Making Changes
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes locally
3. Test thoroughly
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Create Pull Request
6. After review: merge and deploy

### Deployment Process
- Code pushed to `main` branch
- SSH into Digital Ocean server
- Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Restart service: `sudo systemctl restart abg-website`
- Verify: `sudo systemctl status abg-website`

sudo journalctl -u abg-website -f
```

### Development vs Production

**Development Environment:**
- Runs on your local machine (`localhost:3001`)
- Uses development database (port 27018)
- Hot reload (changes appear instantly)
- Development credentials

**Production Environment:**
- Runs on Digital Ocean server
- Uses production database (port 27017)
- Managed by SystemD service
- Production credentials (secure)

## 🔐 Project-Startup API Integration

### Overview
The Project-Startup functionality from the Python repository has been converted to TypeScript and integrated as a secure server-side API with a demo page.

### Files Added
- `src/lib/projectStartup.ts` - Core library with three async functions (generateStartupPlan, getInterviewHelp, ingestText)
- `src/app/api/project-startup/route.ts` - Next.js API route handler
- `src/app/project-startup/page.tsx` - Demo UI page at `/project-startup`

### OPENAI_API_KEY Configuration

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**

1. **No API keys are hardcoded** in this repository. The code uses `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` for the AI provider key.

2. **Mock Responses**: When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, the API returns deterministic mock responses so the site remains functional in development without secrets.

3. **Key Rotation Required**: If you have access to the original AIBuissnessGroup/Project-Startup repository:
   - **DO NOT copy any API keys found there into this repository**
   - **IMMEDIATELY rotate/revoke any OpenAI API keys discovered in Project-Startup**
   - The old keys may have been exposed in git history or logs

4. **Proper Key Storage**:
   - Store replacement API keys as environment variables in `.env.local` for development
   - Add keys to GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipelines
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` if not already present

### Setting Up for Local Development

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```

2. Or run without the key to use mock responses:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3001/project-startup` to test the demo page

### API Usage

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/project-startup`

**Actions**:
- `generate` - Generate a startup plan (requires `payload.idea`)
- `interview` - Get interview questions (optional `payload.role`, `payload.level`)
- `read` - Summarize text (requires `payload.text`)

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "action": "generate",
  "payload": {
    "idea": "A platform connecting students with local businesses",
    "stage": "early"
  }
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "provider": "openai" | "mock",
    "plan": "...",
    "raw": { /* OpenAI response payload */ }
  }
}
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Never** share API keys in Slack, Discord, or public channels
- **Rotate keys** immediately if accidentally exposed
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for production deployments
- **Monitor API usage** for unexpected spikes that might indicate key compromise
- **Set spending limits** in your OpenAI account to prevent abuse
